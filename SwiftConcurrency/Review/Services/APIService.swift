        As you are likely to see still, for quite a while, the older method of dealing with concurrency, we're going to start there.
        This will require using what is known as "-a completion handler-", and eventually we're going to be using "-a result type-" as our completion handler's argument.
        Let's start easy now and build on this concept.
        The reason we need "-a completion handler-" is because we have no idea how long it's going to take for that network call to fetch that data.
        And since our code is inherently synchronous, it would move on to the next line before we received our data.

        And "-the completion handler-" is just a closure that we can pass in as an argument so that it will get executed when that data has been retrieved, and we can give that closure a name.
        And typically people call it something like completion or completion handler.

        So when this function has completed and we'll either have successfully retrieved our JSON and decoded it, or an error will have been produced.
     
            -> A Result Type is simply an enum with two cases, either a success case with an associated value and that associated value will be in our case, the array of users, the successful completion or a failure case where the result is an error type.
            -> A value that represents either a success or a failure, including an associated value in each case.

        There will be another issue, however, as we'll be fetching that from a server and it's going to take some time the function itself will escape the scope before we're done.
        So we'll need to specify that this "-completion handler-" is going to escape.
        So we do that by marking the completion function as @escaping.
        
        âœ… Well, now we can get to work.
